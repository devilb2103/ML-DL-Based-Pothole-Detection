label descriptors to which cluster it belongs
generate histogram for descriptors in each image and label them as pothole and not pothole
train svm and knn gridcv on descriptor histogram
do tfidf reweighting
train svm and knn gridcv on generated tfidf sparse matrices

final output matrix

sift - using histogram
cluster sizes	knn test acc	svm test acc

sift - using tf idf matrix
cluster sizes	knn test acc	svm test acc


TIME TAKEN RECORD ------------------------------
generation of image histogram time taken: 67.8s

KNN_Hist = 1.4s (Acc = 75)
SVM_Hist = 44s (Acc = 76.3)

TFIDF Vectorization = 0s

KNN_TFIDF = 1.8s (Acc = 69.4)
SVM_TFIDF = 0.3s (Acc = 79.1)

Per Model Instance Iteration = 47.5s
Worst Case total time = 2410s = 40min 10s
